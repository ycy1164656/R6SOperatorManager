            "Background": "===Background===Zofia grew up in a comfortable household in Wroclaw, Poland. When she was ten years old, her father resigned from his role as GROM Commander to become the Minister of Internal Affairs following the assassination of Poland’s president. As his eldest daughter, Zofia was the perfect vehicle for his legacy.From a young age, she underwent her father’s strict military training, haunted by the ticking of his pocket watch that timed her to the second. While there were moments when she wanted to rebel against him, she also found comfort in the simple, black-and-white form of validation his system provided.Her lifelong goal became reality when she passed the selection to join the GROM. Her aspiration originated from a powerful moment in her childhood, when she attended the funeral for the President of Poland. During the ceremony, she admired the solemn look the GROM Specialists conveyed, and pictured herself dressed in the iconic uniform.====Decisive====During a school trip to the Masurian Lake District, Zofia was prey to a disturbing prank that almost cost her life. While she played in the lake, three boys from her class took turns trying to drown her, just for ‘fun.’ This violent experience marked her with a deep mistrust of others. The following week, she had to sit beside her assailants in class. To deal with her growing anxiety, she decided to push her training further, and ensure she could protect herself. Her father agreed to show her more ruthless techniques, given she would never question his methods.The next morning, he led Zofia to a shooting range where he had leashed two stray dogs to a target post.\"I still remember what my father said to me that day. 'Your decisions will determine the rest of your life', he said, 'Leaders learn to make the hard ones quickly.’ He took out his pocket watch and timed me.'One of the two dogs was sick, and Zofia had to end its suffering, but which one? \"My father was not teaching me right versus wrong. He was forcing me to make a decision between life and death under 2 minutes, and shoot with conviction. If I had any doubts, I’d end up injuring and torturing the dog.\"It was the price to learn the skills necessary to survive any peril, and withstand dangerous situations. Her eyes locked on target, and she pulled the trigger. The heavy weight on her chest seemed to lift in that short-lived moment, as she caught a glimpse of how strong she would become.====Resilient====Among Zofia’s most notable exploits was a rescue operation in Guatemala, codenamed Red Agatha. A disastrous tropical storm formed a sinkhole in the middle of the city, swallowing an entire neighbourhood. Zofia was deployed to protect a team of engineers examining the perimeter.During a sudden landfall, she hitched a child over her back and ran as the ground disappeared from under her feet.The kid clung to her back and she gripped the edge with her bare hands for the next half hour as she hung over the abyss. To reward her special ability to withstand hardships, Zofia received a medal and was promoted to Second Lieutenant.Throughout her experiences, Zofia forged a second family overseas. To have more impact in the field, she learned to trust her squad mates with her life, re-considering the cruel lesson from the events at Lakeland. Far away from her father’s brutal training, Zofia let down her walls, developing close ties for the first time. She met her now-husband during a rogue operation in Mali, where they both mistook each other for hostiles.====Loyal====At the peak of her career, Zofia flew back to Poland for her wedding ceremony. While she intended the event to be private, her father turned it into a marked celebration, reuniting the clique of politicians who took power after the assassination of Poland’s President. Zofia was shocked to see two former suspects among the crowd, embraced warmly by her father. She left the party early, feigning illness.While investigating what she’d seen, Zofia discovered she was pregnant. Taking an exceptionally early maternity leave. At the family home, Zofia kept her pregnancy hidden from her father. He died in the months that followed, under suspicious circumstances.The birth of Zofia’s daughter had a profound effect on her, igniting a need to cocoon with her family, but [[Ela]] ignored her sister’s attempts to reconnect.Zofia returned to the GROM soon after hearing that [[Ela]] would pass the selection as a civilian. Except for her attempts to reconnect with her sister, Zofia kept her distance with everyone else. Her squadron noticed this change, and wondered if her recent obsession with her father’s pocket watch was a remnant of grief, or something more.When [[Ela]] accepted the prestigious offer to join Team Rainbow, Zofia saw no reason to stay behind; everything about the GROM reminded Zofia of her father.She used her contacts to reach Six personally, who agreed to meet her in Geneva. Zofia joined Team Rainbow three months later.",

She scavenged or bought spare components to build her own computers. She played soccer with the neighborhood boys and got into fights with them, but it was her sharp tongue that landed her in trouble with her teachers. She looked and acted like a troublemaker, so they tried to force her to conform to expectations. To survive, Grace learned to soften her own image, to better play with and manipulate preconceptions; she bought fake glasses and adopted the geek girl persona,Grace's skills earned her a National Scholarship at KAIST (Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology), but after graduating decided to join the Army. Her athleticism and daring paid off, and she was assigned to the ROK, Army Special Warfare Command before earning a spot in the 9th Special Forces Brigade known as the Ghosts. Despite her unorthodox behavior within the highly disciplined ROK Army, she gained notice for her exemplary tech skills and for being highly adaptable to situations. After Grace participated in joint training with Detachment K Green Berets, the American instructors encouraged her to try out with the 70 7th Special Mission Battalion: White Tigers.The White Tigers were a better fit for her skills, but Grace inadvertently butted, heads with Major General Kuh, an old guard soldier with political ties all the way up to the Blue House, who followed orders to the letter and expected unflinching loyalty from his subordinates. Kuh made life difficult for Grace, preventing her from exploiting her full potential.Grace heard about Rainbow during training exercises with the S.A.S., and it sounded like the opportunity she had been seeking... the chance to contribute through her strengths. She knew that Major General Kuh would never put her on the list, so she did what she always did and thought outside the box.[PARAGRAPH REDACTED]Now Dokkaebi is a member of Rainbow to the surprise of Major General Kuh, who is not happy about it. He wants her drummed out of the White Tigers, but Dokkaebi could not be happier. She is among men and women who reward, asymmetrical thinking even though she knows she now has a target on her back, More so, she is sure the other ROK operator, Chul Kyung Hwa, is spying on her. She needs to work twice as hard, but Grace feels twice as motivated now.",

            "Background": "===Background===Olivier was born to a conservative, well-to-do family. His parents and older sister, Sophie, were in medicine and devout Catholics, but he bucked against their accomplishments and their faith. He was smart and arrogant, but he believed rebellion was a better use of his intellect. It was fun to act against expectation, to drink and party... at least it was until he got his girlfriend, Claire, pregnant.He tried to convince Claire to get an abortion, but she refused. Once his parents found out about the pregnancy, they kicked him out of the house; it was the last straw in a string of bad behavior. Depressed, Olivier went on a drug and alcohol fueled bender, getting trashed enough to land in the hospital. That was his wakeup call. He was 18 and nearly homeless, so he joined the French Army out of desperation. He needed purpose.Military life was hard but rewarding. Olivier took solace in purpose and struggled, to break old habits. He started sending money to Claire to support their newborn son even though she did not want to see Olivier. He became a second-level in-combat rescuer, and joined the 2nd Dragoon Regiment in their role as a CBRN, reaction force. He also developed a close relationship with the regiment's Catholic Chaplain, Bertrand, who eventually spoke to Claire and convinced her that Olivier regretted his actions. He arranged a reunion for them.It was a hard moment for Olivier. He met his son, Alexis, the child he wanted aborted, and the reality of his decision hit him hard. He had been selfish, pushing, his girlfriend to do something because it inconvenienced him. More so, Claire was about to get married and Alexis was already calling someone else 'daddy.' Everything he had done, putting his loved ones through hell, shoved him into a wild depression that almost cost him his rank. Chaplain Bertrand helped Olivier through his crisis and with it, he returned to the Catholic Church.Olivier swore he would do everything possible to rectify the pain he had caused, so he worked harder, and sought more challenges. He qualified to join the Groupe d'intervention de la Gendarmerie nationale (GIGN) as their new biohazard expert, using drones to maintain and hold quarantine perimeters. He focused on his duty, on making things right, no matter how much it hurt him in the process. His feelings were irrelevant; what mattered was strict observation of his duty. During | a Yellow Fever outbreak in Sudan, while protecting a field investigation team, his | loud voice scared a frightened mob back and he gained the nickname \"Lion\" from the locals.In 2015, the army asked him to lead the 2nd Dragoons to West Africa to assist medical personnel fighting the Ebola epidemic. Tragedy ensued, and the decisions Olivier made for safety reasons put him at odds with Doc, who blamed him for the death of several medical personnel on-site including Doc's colleague. The tension between the two continues to this day in Team Rainbow.After studying his jacket, Finka recommended Olivier for Rainbow as a CBRN, specialist, and Six agreed. Olivier immediately proved his value when Finka and he uncovered the source of the mysterious mist that came ashore in Sussex and, poisoned people, though he claims he shares that success with Twitch, who provided him with the new aerial drone to locate the mist plume.Olivier has managed to stay in his son's life, but it is an awkward relationship. Alexis does not know how to call him father and Olivier is not sure what it means to be a dad in the day-to-day. He has mended bridges with his parents and, sister, his return to the Catholic faith healing those wounds, and while his decision to be a soldier bothers them, he is no longer the thoughtless rebel. He is not a soldier to make life easy on his soul. He bears the weight of responsibility for what he has done even though Bertrand constantly reminds him that forgiveness is in the heart of God.",

Her diagnosis was the realization of her fears, so when her parents encouraged her and her younger siblings to be physically active, she pushed herself even harder, determined to keep her body in peak condition to weather the neuropathy. She could not be sick if she stayed healthy, her young mind reasoned.All three Melnikova children grew up playing sports, with Lera excelling at those requiring agility and finesse but there was always the knowledge that the neuropathy would worsen unless someone found a more permanent solution. She decided that someone was herself.Lera moved to Novosibirsk to study at Novosibirsk State University and graduated, with a Ph.D. in Microbiology and Immunology. She remained at NSU in the Biotechnology and Virology Laboratory, her research uncovering treatments for a variety of pathogens and neuropathies including her own through drugs and self dissolving nanites. While she hadn't found a cure, she had found remission.Lera might have stayed in Academia had she not received a visit from the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB). Russian Spetsnaz operators and special agents faced the ever-growing danger of exposure to hazardous materials including organophosphorus agents like VX gas. For the first time in her life, Lera began thinking outside of her own concerns. Her research had saved the lives of perfect strangers, and now they were reaching out to her, sending grateful postcards and photos and letters. She could have a greater impact still., Lera jumped at the chance to work with Spetsnaz volunteers in a variety of conditions as she adapted the nanobots to their high-performance physiologies. Quickly, she came to enjoy the sense of competition, camaraderie, and the mental toughness of the Russian Special Forces members. She joined the Army with an eye on becoming a Red Beret herself, on the front lines of saving lives as a Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear (CBRN) specialist.Serving in the Russian Army, Lera rapidly proved herself physically and mentally tough enough to try out for the Spetsnaz. It was a brutal course, culminating in Close Quarter Battle (CQB) knife training with Kapkan. A misstep and a flourish from Kapkan, however, opened her face from brow to cheek, but Lera went for a series of bone-breaking punches to his nose and ribs before the pain overwhelmed her. They spent the night in the med tent, neither of them speaking, but enjoying a new, unspoken respect between them. From that day, forward, she'd earned her moniker, Finka or \"Knife.\"Lera became the Spetsnaz CBRN Specialist, joining the Vympel Unit under the FSB and using her nanobots to help her unit survive hot zones; she was one of the only people capable of tailoring the nanobots to specific operators.Her work in restructuring Russian battlefield protocols in the handling and neutralization of dangerous payloads earned her notice, and she became the goto expert when it came to joint exercises with other CTUs. Six invited Lera to help Rainbow Six put together a CRBN unit of their own with Olivier \"Lion\", Flament as her first pick.",

Little of her childhood is known apart from the meager pension her mother received after her father died. She was six years old when the Pereira family was forced to move to a poor neighborhood in the outskirts of the São Paulo state. She only caught the authorities' attention when she was 16, after her mother reported that she had been missing. A year later, Pereira was arrested miles away on robbery charges in Rio de Janeiro. Remaining poised and displaying intellect throughout the process, Pereira impressed the judge in charge of her case. He was lenient towards her age and character, which, he claimed, showed potential for socio-educational reform. He gave Pereira the choice between entering a juvenile reformatory (FEBEM) and working with BOPE in Rio de Janeiro. Sensing protection for her deviant predisposition, Pereira accepted to become a BOPE criminal informant.===Psychological Report===Pereira excels at extracting information from suspects. Albeit using controversial methods undermining BOPE protocol, she was a key interrogator during the 2010 Rio de Janeiro Security Crisis. Her brutal behavior on the field suggests she may be suffering from an anti-social personality disorder. However, the results of all the tests conducted were inconclusive.===Training===*Policia Civil *BOPE===Relevant Experience===*Criminal informant*Key interrogator during the 2010 Rio de Janeiro Security Crisis*Assault on Complexo do Alemão===Notes===Requires further psychological testing to confirm she is a stable BOPE asset.",

Impressed by her determination and prowess on the field, the GROM saw in her a rare opportunity.

He remembers their train ride when soldiers arrested two fellow defectors. He remembers his sick, mother slowing them all down during the jungle crossing. He remembers leaving, her behind as his father told him not to cry, not to make a noise and alert the armed patrols.Throughout it all, everyone impressed upon Chul Kyung that anything he said or any strange behavior would get them caught... it was life or death. So he buried, his emotions deep, lest he betray his parents and be responsible for their capture; he became a stone to the outside world.Gaining asylum in South Korea, it was not the happy life they'd envisioned The loss of his family proved too much for Chul Kyung's father, who committed suicide, leaving his son an orphan. Chul Kyung remained a stone, never showing emotion, never betraying his inner thoughts.Chul Kyung was adopted into the Hwa family, who believed it best if he forget his past, which started by changing his full name to Chul Kyung Hwa. Chul Kyung was actively encouraged to forget his real name and he obliged. It was another form of camouflage. He grew up in a system of rules and codes of conduct, and they provided him with a reason to be stoic, to follow orders. He could hide behind the rules.Chul Kyung wanted to give back to South Korea, the country that took him in, and he entered the ROK Navy, proving the exemplary sailor. He earned himself a berth in the ROKN UDT/SEALs, not only passing with distinction, but becoming such an exemplary operator in the course of his service that he was handpicked by the 707th Special Mission Battalion: White Tigers. He was diligent, methodical, and tenacious, albeit quiet. Naturally, his status as the child of defectors was not shared with his fellow soldiers to better give him a fair shot, but when South Korea was given an opportunity to send two operators into Rainbow, Chul Kyung was at the top of the list.[PARAGRAPH REDACTED]",

Her bulletproof extendable shield has the ability to slow down opponents by using a high voltage Charged Field Generator (CFG) that emanates directly in front of the shield in a cylindrical shape. Opponents caught in the CFG also sustain low damage over time. Effective use of the shield allows Clash to block entry points, and to prevent or delay a push by the Attackers.Damage：3",

She was relentless until the day her friend and mentor, Tray Pearson, died trying to stop looters during a riot. Two months later, Evans offered her assistance to the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) because she wanted to make a difference from within the system. The MPS offered her a clean slate if she helped stop protests from going violent. Evans made it her career, going from insider to eventually joining the MPS.During the 2011 London Riots, Police Constable Evans commanded the front line in the Territorial Support Group to stop the violence from spreading, and later acquired special permission to attend Gold Command meetings, devising new crowd-control strategies based on her years as riot leader. PC Evans made 274, arrests throughout her service and later made Detective Constable. She earned the Queen's Police Medal for exceptional bravery and earned a spot in Rainbow due to her experience, service record, and tenacity.",
